# Typed Tagless Final Interpreters in Coalton

I'm Coalton-curious, but I have yet to learn any.
I thought I'd work through the typeclass gymnastics in [Typed Tagless Final Interpreters](https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/lecture.pdf) as a way to cut my teeth.
When I'm finished, I'll clean this up, but for now it's just a soup.
